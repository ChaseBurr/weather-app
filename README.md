# Weather App

I created this simple weather api that use's [openweathermap](http://openweathermap.org) api to get weather information based on city.

## Usage

Enter a city nama into the input box and click `GET` and the api will feth the information using a GET request.

## Backend

I decided to use Flask as the backend for this project for it's simplicity.
